## 1. Overview

A short paragraph explaining:

- What problem this agent solves  
- Why you used ADK (and possibly MCP / A2A / tool integration)  
- What kinds of agents (or sub-agents) you built  
- How this ties into the codelabs / hackathon you chose  

---

## 2. Features & Agent Architecture

Describe:

- Which ADK codelab(s) you implemented (e.g. *From Prototypes to Agents with ADK*, *Building AI Agents with Tools*)  
- Which hackathon / sample from **awesome-adk-agents** you built on  
- What tools your agent uses (APIs, databases, search, web scrapers, external services)  
- How agents communicate / orchestrate (e.g. orchestrator / worker agents, parallel flows)  
- Any fallback or error handling
