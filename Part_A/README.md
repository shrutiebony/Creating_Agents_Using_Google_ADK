#### Project Structure
1) Codelab 1 – From Prototypes to Agents with ADK: Go from initial prompt-based prototypes to a structured agent pipeline. 
Google Codelabs
2) Codelab 2 – Building AI Agents with ADK: Empowering with Tools: Learn how to extend agents with tools (APIs, DBs, custom functions), and make them more than chatbots. 
Google Codelabs
3) Codelab 3 – Build a Travel Agent using MCP Toolbox & ADK: Apply both the Agent Development Kit (ADK) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) Toolbox for Databases to build a real-world travel assistant.
4) Hackathon Project – Agent Application Implementation: Choose an agent from the curated list in the Awesome ADK Agents repository (90+ templates & community-built agents) 

#### Features
Structured learning: from basic to intermediate to real-world application
Focused on modern workflows: agents with tools, multi-agent orchestration, MCP integration
